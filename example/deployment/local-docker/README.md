# Docker Example

This example demonstrates different users querying an avro file over a REST api running locally in docker containers.

The example runs several different queries by the different users, with different purposes. When you run the example you will see the data has been redacted in line with the rules.  
For an overview of the example see [here](../../README.md)

### Prerequisites for running in docker 
As well as docker, running this example alse requires docker compose

To run the example locally in docker containers follow these steps (from the root of the project):

1. Compile the code
```bash
mvn clean install -P example
```

2. Start the REST services

If you have made changes to the code since you last built the docker containers then you will need to run:

*NOTE* This will clean all stopped docker services, requiring them to be rebuilt when you next want to start them up. 
```bash
 ./example/deployment/local-docker/bash-scripts/dockerCleanSystem.sh
```

Then you can start up the docker containers:
```bash
 ./example/deployment/local-docker/bash-scripts/dockerComposeUp.sh
```

You can check the containers are available:

```bash
  docker ps
```

You should see 8 containers that will stay around and 2 others will disappear once complete (configure-services, configure example):

![Output from docker ps](../../../doc/img/DockerPSScreenshot.png?raw=true "Output from docker ps")


3. Run the example

This script will not run if the `dockerComposeUp.sh` script has not been run.

```bash
  ./example/deployment/local-docker/bash-scripts/runLocalDockerExample.sh
```
   Or for an easier to read output
```bash
  ./example/deployment/local-docker/bash-scripts/runFormattedLocalDockerExample.sh
```  

This just runs the java class: uk.gov.gchq.palisade.example.multi-jvm-example-docker-runner. You can just run this class directly in your IDE.

4. Stop the REST services


```bash
 ./example/deployment/local-docker/bash-scripts/dockerComposeDown.sh
```

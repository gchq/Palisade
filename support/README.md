# Support

This module contains the various Palisade support components. These depend on other Palisade services, but are not services in their own right.

<span style="color:red">**Note:** As noted in the [documentation root](../README.md) Palisade is in an early stage of development, therefore the precise APIs contained in these service modules are likely to adapt as the project matures.</span>

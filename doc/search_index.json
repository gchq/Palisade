Tool for Complex and Scalable Data Access Policy Enforcement\nPalisade aims to provide a stable framework for defining and enforcing policies for accessing data.\nIntroduction\nModern organisations can have multiple datasets that are each managed and accessed according to different policies and procedures.\nThis can make it complicated for analysis while still ensuring regulatory compliance.\nMost technologies \"out of the box\" do not provide the necessary solution for managing these complex issues for data access.\nThis leads to access to data being overly restrictive with potential insights from data being lost.\nPalisade can provide a solution to this problem; It consists of a set of services for enforcing complex data access policies across different datasets and platforms.\nThese services are able to provide modular data access controllers and independent peripheral services to allow policies to be integral to the process a client uses to access data.\nConsider the example of a set of datasets may have been assembled for specific purposes.\nFor a given dataset, only particular types of query are permitted for certain types of user.\nAlso, within each dataset a specific user may only be permitted to access a particular subset of the records.\nPalisade allows the policies for accessing datasets, redacting records and executing the query to be specified independently of the physical data and the platform hosting the data.\nThis will enable the clients to perform queries across the datasets while still conforming to company and regulatory policies.  \nPolicies are set per resource and are not changed by the user or context.\nHowever, the policies can use the information about the user and context to decide how the data needs to be sanitised for any particular query.\nThis can be applied on a per-field basis.\nThis means that fields in a record can be redacted or masked based on:\n\nthe contents of the record\nthe user accessing the record \nthe contextual information provided by the user or the system at the time of the query.\n\nPalisade's aim is to provide a stable framework for enforcing policy and auditing requirements for data access requests, while, at the same time, not limiting the solution to any single platform ecosystem.\nPalisade can be deployed into many different ecosystems such as Hadoop, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.\nAs adoption of Palisade grows, then the burden of creating new connectors (between Palisade and new technologies for storing and processing data) can be shared across the community.\n\nIf required, Palisade allows an organisation to use centralised services which each deployment of Palisade's data access services can share.\nThis means that your data access policies, audit logs, user account details etc. don't need to be duplicated on every system.\nOf course, Palisade can still be deployed locally on a per-platform basis.\nAdditional Information\nFor a quickstart in using Palisade, see the guide here.\nFor more information on Palisade, take a look here.\nFor any questions or help please contact using the GitHub Issue tracking system.\nGo to the Issue page and create and enter your query in a new issue and then submit.\nWe will try to respond as quick as possible in the form of a comment to the issue.\nHere is the link to Palisade issues.\nStatus\nPalisade is still in development and is not production ready.\nThis information will be updated when there is a scheduled date for the production release.\nLicense\nPalisade

process\n\nDeploy prerequisites:\n\nDocker for building containers\nKubernetes for cluster orchestration and container management\nHelm 3 for deploying to Kubernetes and managing deployments\n\nGitHub Repositories\nThe Palisade project has been divided into a set of separate GitHub repositories for simplification of development and maintenance.\nThey consist of the following:\nPalisadeDocumentation for how Palisade works at a high level\nPalisade ClientsClient code for using Palisade from different data processing technologies, different language libraries, or slightly different implementations each with pros and cons.\nPalisade ServicesLibrary of code for the services used in the application\nPalisade ExamplesCode examples showing an example of how Palisade can be used, as well as performance tests in synthetic scenarios\nPalisade ReadersLibrary of code for connecting Palisade into different data storage technologies, such as Hadoop or S3\nPalisade Integration TestsFull-system tests such as smoke-tests and setup for exploratory testing (at time of writing, this is mostly unused)\nPalisade Readers, Clients, and Services are all required to run the existing solution.\nThe examples provide a demonstration of how the automated policy rule enforcement is applied to data being read by a user.\nThe examples will provide a good start to understanding how Palisade works.\nFor an overview of the examples see here.\nContributing\nWe welcome contributions to the project.\nDetailed information on our ways of working can be found here.\nThe following gives some useful documentation intended to help with the developer onboarding experience:\n\nInitial Requirements\nDesign Principles\nHigh level architectural diagram\nStandard flow for a read request through the

model\nIssues\nPull requests\nCoding style\nJavadoc\nTests\n\nGit branching model\nWe have adopted the following branching strategy - see Git Branching Model\nIssues\nWhere possible, a pull request should correlate to a single GitHub issue.\nAn issue should relate to a single functional or non-functional change - changes to alter/improve other pieces of functionality should be addressed in a separate issue in order to keep reviews atomic.\nThe reasoning behind code changes should be documented in the GitHub issue. \nAll resolved issues should be included in the next GitHub milestone, this enables releases to be linked to the included issues.\nIf a code change requires users to make changes in order for them to adopt it, then the issue should be labelled 'migration-required', and a comment should be added similar to:\n### Migration Steps\n\n[Description of what needs to be done to adopt the code change with examples]\nWorkflow\n\nAssign yourself to the issue\nCreate a new branch off develop using pattern PAL-[issue number]-[issue-title]\nCommit your changes prefixing your commit title with PAL-[issue-number] [commit title]\nCheck your changes\nCreate a pull request to merge your branch into develop\nThe pull request will be reviewed and following any changes and approval your branch will be merged into develop\nDelete the branch\n\nPull Requests\nPull requests will undergo an in depth review by a Palisade committer to check the code changes are compliant with our coding style.\nThis is a community so please be respectful of other members - offer encouragement, support and suggestions. \nAs described in our git branching model - please raise pull requests to merge your changes into our develop branch.\nPlease agree to the GCHQ OSS Contributor License Agreement before submitting a pull request.\nCoding style\nPlease ensure your coding style is consistent with rest of the project and follow coding standards and best practices.\nIn general, follow the Gaffer Codestyle\nIn particular please ensure you have adhered to the following:\n\nStrive for small, easy to read, and easy to understand classes and methods\nSeparate out related classes into packages and avoid highly coupled classes and modules\nCheckstyle is run as part of 'mvn package' so you should ensure your code is compliant\nThe project will not build if there are issues which cause these plugins to fail\n\n\nSonarQube and Hadolint are run by the CI/CD pipeline so you should ensure your code is compliant\nThe pipeline will not complete successfully if there are issues which cause these checks to fail\n\n\nClasses and methods should comply with the single responsibility principal\nAvoid magic numbers and string literals\nAvoid coupling services, if necessary duplicate code so individual services can be updated without causing cascading issues\nLook after your streams - if you open one make sure you close it too\nThis should apply to all volatile resource usage\n\n\nDon't swallow exceptions - ensure they are logged or rethrown\nGive credit for other peoples work\nUpdate the NOTICES file for changes to the dependencies\nConsider the scope of dependencies - restrict them when possible using the appropriate maven scope\nDon't expose private logic in classes through public methods\nField access should be controlled via getters and setters\nMake use of the core Java API - don't reinvent the wheel\nMake use of generic typing\nMake use of appropriate object-oriented design patterns\nUse Loggers instead of System.out.print and Throwable.printStackTrace\nEnsure that the toString(), equals() and hashCode() methods are implemented where appropriate\nGenerated code should be tagged with a @Generated annotation such that it is excluded from coverage metrics\n\nJavadoc\nEnsure your java code has sufficient Javadoc explaining what the section of code does and the intended use of it.\nJavadoc should be used in addition to clean readable code, it is not an excuse to write lazy code.\nMethod bodies should also be accompanied by inline comments where appropriate.\nIn particular, the following are required:\n\npublic classes (not required for test classes unless an explanation of the testing is required)\npublic methods (not required if the functionality is obvious from the method name e.g. getters and setters)\npublic constants (not required if the constant is obvious from the name)\n\nAny other access modifiers may have Javadoc or standard Java comments.\nTests\n\nAll new code should be unit tested\nWhere this is not possible the code should be invoked and the functionality should be tested in a component or contract test\nIn a small number of cases this will not be possible - instead steps to verify the code should be thoroughly documented\n\n\nTests should cover edge cases and exception cases as well as normal expected behavior\nKeep each test decoupled and don't rely on tests running in a given order - don't save state between tests\nFor a given code change, aim to improve the tests' code coverage\nUnit test classes should test a single class and be named [testClass]Test\nComponent test classes should test a single 'feature' and and be named [feature]Test\nContract test classes should test the external communications made, whether network, file IO, or otherwise\nTests should use JUnit 5.x and AssertJ\nComponent tests will likely use a Spring test annotation such as @WebMvcTest\nContract tests will likely use a Testcontainer such as KafkaTestcontainer\n\n\nTests should be readable and self documenting where possible\nAssertJ's .as(..) should be added to all assertions to aid in documenting in this way\n\n\nWe suggest the following pattern:\n@Test\nvoid testSomeThingDoesSomeBehaviour {\n    // Given\n    [Setup your test here]\n\n    // When\n    [Invoke the test method]\n\n    // Then\n    [assert the method did what was expected]\n}\n\n\n\n"},"src/initial_requirements.html":{"url":"src/initial_requirements.html","title":"Initial Requirements","keywords":"","body":"\nInitial Requirements\nMust have\n\nCan use a

Descriptions\nMessage Sequence through the Palisade System\n\nThe above shows how messages might travel, and which services talk to which others.\nClients\nThe job of the client code is to send the request for data into Palisade and to interpret the result as required for the data processing technology it is written for.\nThe responsibility for implementations of the client code is to provide users with a way to request data from Palisade in a way that the user has to make minimal changes to how they would normally use that processing technology.\nImplementations of this component will usually require deep understanding of the data processing technology in order to best hook into that technology, without needing to fork the code for that technology.\nPalisade Service\nThe Palisade Service is the entry-point to the Palisade system.\nA client will register a request with the Palisade Service and be returned a token, which will uniquely identify their request - e.g. to the Filtered-Resource Service and Data Service.\nUser Service\nThe User Service is responsible for retrieving details about the user from an authoritative source.\nThis may be an LDAP User Service, Amazon Cognito, or any other User Service provider.\nResource Service\nThe Resource Service is responsible for providing the detailed information about each resource based on a resource id (path or alias) being managed by Palisade.\nThe detailed information the service provides could be the type and format of data in that resource, when the resource was created, additional access controls, data lifetime and expiry, categorisation and tagging, etc.\nPolicy Service\nThe Policy Service is responsible for providing a mapping from resources to a set of rules (filters or transformations) that need to be applied, based on the user and query context.\nThe service itself manages additional hierarchical logic, such that rules applied to parent resources are also applied to their children.\nAttribute-Masking Service\nThe Attribute-Masking Service persists the provided context for an authorised data read, that is the token and resource id are used as a key and the user, resource, context and rules as a value.\nThis will later be queried by the Data Service.\nThe service then decides what metadata attached to resources is returned to the client.\nTopic-Offset Service\nThe Topic-Offset Service can be thought of as a basic performance optimisation to prevent reading through the whole kafka queue repeatedly.\nThe Topic-Offset Service watches the output of the Attribute-Masking Service, decides if a message indicates the start of a set of results for a token, and if so will record this position.\nThis will be used later by the Filtered-Resource Service for connecting to the queue in this exact position.\nFiltered-Resource Service\nThe Filtered-Resource Service is an exit-point from the Palisade system.\nA client will connect to the Filtered-Resource Service with their token and receive a stream of resource metadata back.\nEach of these responses can be requested from the Data Service, which will return the data records.\nData Service\nThe Data Service is responsible for returning requested record data to the client.\nThis further involves validating the request, gathering the required trusted information (rules and the context in which to apply them) from the Attribute-Masking Service, and auditing what data was returned.\nData Reader\nThe job of the Data Reader is to read a single resource, de-serialise it into the format that the set of rules for this resource will expect and then apply those rules before passing the data back to the Data Service.\nThe Data Reader should also be able to push down filters where appropriate to optimise the read process, e.g. to only retrieve certain columns from a columnar database or a particular row range.\nIt is this component that is unique to each data storage technology, not the Data Service as a whole.\nAudit Service\nThe Audit Service is responsible for recording audit logs as requested by other services.\nThe audit logs produced by the services should be verbose by default.\nThey will then be filtered, organised and reduced by the Audit Service.\n"},"src/read_process.html":{"url":"src/read_process.html","title":"Standard Flow of Read

deployed?\nKubernetes (Locally or AWS EKS)\n\n* Service in this case means K8s Service resource, which acts as an in-cluster DNS name.\nPalisade primarily supports deployment through helm to a K8s cluster.\nThis allows for containerisation, scaling and auto-recovery on service failure.\nPalisade is regularly deployed to local K8s clusters for manual developer testing, and to AWS EKS for CI/CD automated testing.\nIn this deployment, containers for each microservice are managed by various K8s workload resources, notably Deployments and Statefulsets.\nThese can then be scaled up or down as appropriate, with the optional metrics-server responsible for horizontal auto-scaling.\nThe Palisade services are accessed through a Traefik ingress, which is installed into the kube-system namespace rather than with the rest of the Palisade services (the palisade namespace in this diagram).\nEach microservice is responsible for its own volume mounts, configuration, and ingress-route if any.\nRedis and Kafka can be either installed into the same namespace as the Palisade services, or in a separate namespace not managed by Palisade (the shared-infra in this diagram).\nJVM Processes\n\nPalisade also supports running as bare JVM processes outside of K8s, but of course without any of the benefits provided by K8s.\nThe quickstart.cmd script runs using this approach, as it does not depend on availability of a cluster, as well as offering slightly faster startup times.\nThis is intended as a proof-of-concept and for lighter-weight testing, rather than as a production-ready deployment.\nIn this deployment, a separate JVM is spawned for each microservice and will run unmanaged.\nThis means services will not recover from crashes or critical errors.\nThe Palisade services are accessed through their localhost address and port.\nEach microservice uses the local filesystem without any additional volume mounts.\nn.b. Redis and Kafka are still required in some form, whether exposed in a local K8s cluster, running as local processes, or hosted externally as a SaaS.\n"},"src/palisade_clients.html":{"url":"src/palisade_clients.html","title":"Palisade Clients","keywords":"","body":"\nPalisade Clients\nThis section gives some insight into how clients could be used as the entry point for users to access data via Palisade.\nReading a stream of data\nBy default, the Data Service presents an HTTP stream of binary data to the client on request.\nA code sample using the client-akka package to read all AVRO resources in a dataset (without the client interpreting the AVRO data):\nvoid printInputStream(InputStream is) {\n    new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is))\n        .lines()\n        .forEach(line -> System.out.println(line));\n}\n\nvoid doRequest() {\n    String token = client.register(\"Alice\", \"file:/palisade-data-store/dataset-1/\", \"\").toCompletableFuture().join()\n    Source avroResources = client.fetch(token).filter(resource -> resource.getType().equals(\"AVRO\"));\n    Source avroRecords = avroResources.flatMapConcat(resource -> client.read(token, resource));\n    avroRecords.runWith(Sink.forEach(this::printInputStream), materializer);\n}\n\nIn reality, this Source would be interpreted by the client using an AVRO deserialiser.\nUsing the 'cat' command line tool\nIt should be possible to use command line tools like 'cat' to be able to view files that are being protected by Palisade. \nTo do that, we would need to write a client that mimics the behaviour of the 'cat' command but routing the request for data via Palisade. \nThen you could alias 'cat' to run that client code. \nTherefore, to the end user, there is very little difference to how they would normally use 'cat' if they did not have the data access policy restrictions.\nCreating an S3 client endpoint\nIt should be possible to create an S3 endpoint that allows any out of the box data processing technology that supports S3 to route requests via Palisade. \nThis mechanism would require a way to register your user supplied information such as the purpose for your query to a separate service which provides you a token to embed in the resource URL.\nThen the client would be able to go to strip out the context token and retrieve the contextual information to be used by Palisade.\nReading a stream of data using Apache Spark\nIf you had a data stream in Kafka, you would normally be able to access it using kafka connectors in Java or Python.\nHowever, it would not apply the data filtering/transformations that are required by the data policies.\nTherefore, we want to be able to provide the user with as similar an experience as possible so the user hardly realises any difference.\nTo do that we would want the user to start the job off by running the following: \nspark.readStream\n    .option(\"purpose\", \"example purpose\")\n    .format(\"uk.gov.gchq.palisade\")\n    .load(\"data_set\")\n    .select(\"colA\", \"colB\")\n    .show()\n\nWe would expect that Spark would create a filter to be pushed down to the data reader that says it only wants \"colA\" and \"colB\".\nThe Spark client for Palisade would create a user (based on who is running the command) and take the resource, purpose and filter to register a data request with the Palisade service.\nThen the Spark client would then take the response of that request and split the list of resources over the number of executors Spark is running.\nThen it would get each executor to request access to the subset of resources assigned to that executor.\nThe Data Service receives the request for data, validates the request and the resources allowed, and gets the data access policies that apply to those resources.\nThen the Data Service can read the resource applying the column selection (columns requested plus any columns required to apply the policy) then apply the policies, transform the data so only the two requested columns are returned and then stream the data back to the executor that made the request.\nThe Spark client can format the stream of data into a DataFrame so that the standard Spark code can do the rest of the request.\nTherefore, as far as the user is concerned, they just had to add the option and use the different format, as they would not be able to access the data via any of the other formats.\nThis keeps the API similar to Spark's standard read API. \n"},"src/security_considerations.html":{"url":"src/security_considerations.html","title":"Security Considerations","keywords":"","body":"\nSecurity considerations\nDuring the design of Palisade, we spent some time thinking about how we would be able to authenticate who the user is (the user that is requesting access to the data).\nThe security boundaries for the recommended K8s deployment of Palisade are at the point of the client connecting to the Palisade, Filtered-Resource or Data Services (any service exposed by some ingress).\nThis can mostly be handled by the User Service authenticating the original request and credentials from the Palisade Service, with all others using the supplied token generated by the Palisade Service.\nThe main reason this gets tricky is because we expect Palisade to be used to access data in a distributed way over a cluster.\nTherefore, the client authentication token is only going to be available on the machine that the client is running the client code on and not necessarily available at the point at which the distributed code is requesting the data from the Data Services.\nThat is why we have to register the data request with the Palisade Service - the Palisade Service can then provide a token to be passed to the Filtered-Resource or Data Service to authenticate that the same user is requesting access to the desired resource.\nThis keeps the task of authentication decoupled and handled solely by the User Service.\nThe Data Service validates the token and uses it to get the required and trusted details from a shared cache (see the Attribute-Masking Service).\nThis is to satisfy Hadoop's security architecture.\nIn environments where users run as themselves (as opposed to everybody running as the Hadoop processing user), we can do client-auth at on connection to the Palisade Service and again at the connection to Data Service.\nThe underlying mechanism still works identically, but in addition we can also validate that a user is using the Token assigned to them by the Palisade Service and detect if that Token is being used by a different user (spoofing).\nThis validation check can not be done with Hadoop.\n"}}}

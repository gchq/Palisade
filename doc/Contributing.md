###How to contribute to Palisade

?? 
?? Check to see what we will use for reporting issues.  Will it be GitHub Issue Tracking?

?? Suggest a single issue tracking for all external issues.

?? Assuming that there is one point for all issues.

?? could include a "template" outlining what needs to be in an issue, suggestion and "pull request" contribution

?? set-up so contributers can agree to the CLA.

?? we have our own defition of code style.  Can I expect that we will ask them to run it using checkstyle.

All of the code is in GiHub repository listed in [Documentation](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade/blob/doc/developer-guide/developer_guide.md).  The workflow that is used to develop and add changes is known as GitHub flow.  The reporting of issues, and suggestions for enhancement use the GiTHub issue functionality.  Code changes are sent as pull requests.  If you are un-famluar with these concepts or just need a refresher, there is some good documentation provided on the GitHub guides web site  [GitHub guides web site](https://guides.github.com)

###Reporting a bug
1) Check and make sure that you are working with the latests release of the code.
2) Ensure that the bug has not already been reported by searching on GitHiub under [issues](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade/issues).
3) If you are unable to find an issue that describes the one you have found, open a [new issue](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade/issues/new).  Include a title, which repository the bug is related to, a clear description, as much relevant information as possible and a code sample or test case demonstrating the problem.  The more detail the better as it will help us work towards understanding and resolving the issue.


###Enhancement Suggestion
1) Ensure that the enhancement  has not already been reported by searching on GitHiub under [issues](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade/issues).
2) If you are unable to find an issue that describes the one you have found, open a [new issue](https://github.com/gchq/Palisade/issues/new).  Include a title, which repository the enhancement is related to, a clear description, as much relevant information as possible and a code sample or test case demonstrating the problem.

3) Create your own branch off of develop for the repository that is to be changed.  Include a with some description in the name of your branch.
4) Make all of the changes to code with clear documentation and unit tests for the changes. 
5) Run checkstyle over the code to make any changes for conforming to the existing existing against the style check available in the repository

# Client Implementations

This directory contains the various client implementations for Palisade. Some are intended to be used as standalone implementations such
as the [cat client](cat-client/README.md), whilst others are the necessary client library implementations to allow Palisade to be
used with other frameworks such as the [MapReduce client](mapreduce-client/README.md).

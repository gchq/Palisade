/**
 * The core API for the audit service. This service is responsible for logging audit messages, whether that is locally
 * or to a centralised repository. Implementations of the audit service may include proxies to forward the messages to
 * another audit service, aggregator's to reduce the volumes of logging to be stored as well as implementations that
 * actually write the logs to storage. By splitting the functionality of the audit components in this way, where they
 * all implement this interface but do some small processing before passing to the next component, for example proxy -
 * receiver - aggregator - storage. It means that if we don't want to aggregate audit records then we just remove the
 * aggregator implementation when building that micro-service.

# Services

A collection of the different Palisade Services. The implementations 
are located within the service-impl module.

Always check that there is not an existing service that could be tweaked before creating a new service.

<span style="color:red">**Note:** As noted in the [documentation root](../README.md) Palisade is in an early stage of development, therefore the precise APIs contained in these service modules are likely to adapt as the project matures.</span>

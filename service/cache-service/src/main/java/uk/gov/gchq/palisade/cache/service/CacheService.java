/**
 * The core API for the cache service.
 * The purpose of the cache service is to store the information that the data
 * service will require based on a 'registerDataRequest' made to the palisade
 * service. The reason this is required is because you might have multiple
 * instances of the palisade service running and the registration request might
 * go to a different palisade service to the getDataRequestConfig.
 * The data in the cache should be maintained by a time to live value rather than
 * removing after the get request as any scalable deployment would likely make
 * multiple requests to the cache due to many data services working on a subset
 * of the list of resources in parallel.

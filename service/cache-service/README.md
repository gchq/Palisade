# Cache Service

<span style="color:red">**Note:** As noted in the [documentation root](../../README.md) Palisade is in an early stage of development, therefore the precise APIs contained in these service modules are likely to adapt as the project matures.</span>

## Overview

The core API for the cache service.

The purpose of the cache service is to act as a short term caching layer between 
a service and a backing store that ultimately stores the data for the duration 
of the TTL. As such the cache service will usually be part of another services 
process and not shared between different services. 

## Operation

The cache service has four methods `add()`, `get()`, `remove()` and `list()`.

The data in the cache should be maintained by a time to live (TTL) value rather than
manually removing after the get request as any scalable deployment would likely make
multiple requests to the cache due to many data services working on a subset
of the list of resources in parallel.

The cache service will store Java objects for a given length of time. How these objects are stored is left unspecified.
The cache requests themselves (see `AddCacheRequest` for an example) are all namespaced according to the Palisade service
that they are representing. This means that different services have a separate key space, thus avoiding
de-duplication of keys across various Palisade services. The `CacheRequest` class contains methods for setting the service
class type for a particular request.

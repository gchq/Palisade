/**
 * <p>
 * The core API for the resource service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The resource service is the Palisade component that determines what resources are available that meet a specific
 * (type of) request and how they should be accessed. This interface details several methods for obtaining a list of
 * resources, e.g. by type or by data format. The methods of this service all return {@link CompletableFuture}s of
 * {@link Map}s which link a valid {@link Resource} with a {@link ConnectionDetail} object. The ${@code
 * ConnectionDetail} objects contain information on how to set up a connection to retrieve a particular resource.
 * Implementations of this service do not deal with the filtering or application of security policy to the resources.
 * Therefore, a result returned from a method call on this interface doesn't guarantee that the user will be allowed to
 * access it by policy. Other components of the Palisade system will enforce the necessary policy controls to prevent
 * access to resources by users without the necessary access rights.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: None of the ${@code getResourcesByXXX} methods in this class will return in error if there
 * don't happen to be any resources that do not match a request, instead they will simply return empty ${@link Map}
 * instances.
 * </p>

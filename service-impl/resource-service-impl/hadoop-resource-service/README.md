# Hadoop Resource Service

A Hadoop implementation for the Resource Service.

This Resource service is a wrapper around the Hadoop command line tools and allows 
for resources to be found from Hadoop filesystems and extra metadata such as the data service 
to be used to access each resource type to be persisted via a cache service.

# HDFS Resource Service

A HDFS implementation for the Resource Service.

This Resource service is a wrapper around the HDFS command line tools and allows 
for resources to be found from HDFS and extra metadata such as the data service 
to be used to access each resource type to be persisted via a cache service.
